to create react app
we need to run npm i -g create-react-app   >in command prompt  // it will downloand all files to create react app

then we need to run create-react-app any-name

finnally we need to run npm start run

check all react files listed in vs code like node_modules, public, src etc.,

delete all files in src folder except index.js

create componants folder under src folder and create App.js under components 

its like C:\Users\ELCOT\intro-to-react\src\components\App

then delete all lines in index.js and write the below code

1. index.js  > to link App file to index.html file

import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./components/App"


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))

2. App.js here we can wire code for body of the html in index.html

some example

import React from "react"

const App = () => {
  const myItem = "abushu"

  return (
    <ul>
      <li>itemm kadhf1</li>
      <li>item2 dffajddfaaa {myItem}</li>
      <li>{myItem.toUpperCase()}</li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export default App
